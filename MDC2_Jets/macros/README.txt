anything that says "JetFinder" is actually just a sed replacement of a copy of "AnaTutorial" from Joe's presentation this summer. This means that, as of its creation, it is not unique in its functionality, but it has its own name and is funtional (between making/linking/macros/filenames/etc.)

The hope is to do something similar in coresoftware/simulation/g4simulation/g4jets/ and create a .cc and .h that access the funtions in coresoftware/simulation/g4simulation/g4jets/TowerJetInput.cc to get the pseudojet vector of towers used to cluster
